# C-simple-calcular

This code allows the user to input two numbers and an operator, and then performs the specified operation on the numbers and prints the result. It uses a switch statement to handle the different operations, and outputs an error message if an invalid operator is entered.

You can modify and expand upon this code to add more functionality to your calculator, such as support for more advanced operations or the ability to handle more than two numbers. Happy coding!
